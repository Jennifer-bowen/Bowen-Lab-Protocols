This is a brief guide to setting up Github on your computer for uploading protocols to the newly created protocols github page. 

Github is a tool used to collaborate with other users on computer-based projects. In our case, it will serve as a centralized location to store all of our protocols. This centralized location is called a repository. To add files to this repository, you will make a copy (clone) of it on your local machine, make changes, and then push these changes to github. 


## <ins>Setting up Github:</ins>
1. First, create a github account associated with your Northeastern or personal email at github.com.
2. Next, download Github Desktop.
3. Github can be used from the terminal or command line of your computer, but Github Desktop is a much more user friendly option.
4. Ask Jennifer Bowen to add you as a collaborator to the Bowen Lab Protocol repository.

## <ins>Cloning the repository:</ins>
1. Navigate to the Bowen Lab Protocol repository (https://github.com/Jennifer-bowen/Bowen-Lab-Protocols), click on the big green “<> Code” button, and copy the https link to your clipboard.
2. On Github Desktop, select the “clone repository” option. Copy and paste the url from the Bowen Lab Protocol repository into the “URL” option/
3. In the “local path” field, decide where on your computer you want this repository to be stored. This is the location on your computer you will add protocol files to. Make sure to name it something you will remember.
4. Now, you should have a copy of the repository on your computer.

## <ins>Making changes to the repository:</ins>
- Note: any changes you make to the repository on your local computer will be reflected on github once pushed. Don’t move files around without a plan!
1. Before making any changes, make sure to fetch origin to update your computer’s clone to the most recent version of the repository.
2. Make changes to the repository as you need (I.e. creating new folders, adding new protocol files, etc)
3. Once you have finished making changes, commit these files on Github Desktop. Make sure to write a descriptive title and describe what changes you are making to the repository.
4. After committing, push origin to publish these changes to the repository. Your changes are now published!

## <ins>General tips:</ins>
- Make sure to fetch origin before making changes to the clone of the repository on your computer!
- Upload PDFs (or better yet, .md files), not .docx or other files.
